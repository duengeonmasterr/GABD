# GABD: Gaussian and Binomial distributions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)]()

### What is it?
Statistics is already hard enough to understasnd, let alone code them.
This package is made with the sole purpose of making available statistical tools available in Python.
Currently, this package has two main classes namely: [Gaussian](Docs/Gaussian/gaussianDistribution.md)
 and [Binomial](Docs/Binomial/binomialDistribution.md). Check out their docs on how to use it.
 
- GABD is a python package that helps you to calculate Gaussian and Binomial distribution very easily. 
 
### Where to get it
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/duengeonmasterr/gabd

## Key features

1. Easily create instances of gaussian distribution by passing the mean and standard deviationof data.
2. Easily create instances of binomial distribution by passing the probability and standard deviation.
3. Calculate mean and standard deviation of the data.
4. Read file using in-built functions.
5. Add Gaussian or Binomial instances simply using the + operator.
6. Easy format for viewing details of an instance.


Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python package index](https://pypi.org/project/gabd/).
 
```sh
pip install gabd
```
